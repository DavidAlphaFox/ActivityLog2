;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This code works on the assumption that a certain route is traversed many
;; times (in different sessions or as laps of the same session), therefore
;; multiple elevation readings are available for the same positions (or close
;; by) at different times (as different A_TRACKPOINT records).  The code works
;; by averaging the elevation of all the available trackpoints recorded around
;; certain position.
;;
;; It will work best if a route is traversed several times and won't do
;; anything useful for a route that is traversed only once.
