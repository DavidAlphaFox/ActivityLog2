;;; Commentary

;; The names of these metrics are trademarked, and cannot be used in code that
;; displays the metric to the user.  GoldenCheetah uses the following names
;; instead:
;;
;; IsoPower for Normalized Power (NP)
;; BikeIntensity for Intensity Factor (IF)
;; BikeStress for Training Stress Score (TSS)
;;
;; The `cg-metrics` function in this file calculates all three metrics


;; Calculate the Normalized Power metric, as defined by Andy Coggan.  See
;; `cg-metrics` for the meaning of the arguments.  Also, you probably want to
;; use `cg-metrics` instead, as it returns the intensity factor and TSS as
;; well.
;;
;; The algorithm is explained here
;; https://forum.slowtwitch.com/Slowtwitch_Forums_C1/Triathlon_Forum_F1/Normalized_Power_Formula_or_Calculator..._P3097774/
;;
;; This is the algorithm outline:
;;
;; 1) starting at the 30 s mark, calculate a rolling 30 s average (of the
;; preceeding time points, obviously).
;;
;; 2) raise all the values obtained in step #1 to the 4th power.
;;
;; 3) take the average of all of the values obtained in step #2.
;;
;; 4) take the 4th root of the value obtained in step #3.
;;
;; The original algorithm does not specify how to handle recording pauses,
;; zero values, variable recording intervals and missing data.  This
;; algorithm:
;;
;; * will discard pauses if "timer" is used as a weight series and will
;; include them if "elapsed" is used instead.
;;
;; * will deal with non-regular sampling interval by using the average between
;; two adjacent samples.
;;
;; * will treat missing data as 0
;;
;; The algorithm produces values that are close (within 1 watt) to Golden
;; Cheetah and to what Garmin FR920 produces for sessions w/o dropouts or
;; spikes.  The FR920 produces much higher values if there is missing data +
;; spikes -- not sure how they calculate those values.
;;
;; Note that the function returns #f if the requested interval is too short.

;;
;; SERIES -- the "power" series on which to calculate the metrics (defaults to
;; "pwr")
;;
;; WEIGHT -- the "time" series used to measure time.  Meaningful values are
;; "timer" for the activity times (without counting stops) or "elapsed" which
;; includes stop.  This could also be "dst" for distance, if you wish to
;; calculate NP on distance, but no one does that.

;; INCLUDE-PARTIAL? -- whether to include a partial rolling average window at
;; the start.  The original algorithm does not (#f), but Golden Cheetah
;; includes it (#t).  Makes a small difference to the resulting metrics.
;;
;; START, STOP -- the start and end positions in the data-frame to use.  This
;; can be used to calculate the metrics for an interval.
