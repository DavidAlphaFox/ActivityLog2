This is ActivityLog2, a fitness activity tracker.

The application can read sport activities from .FIT files (as produced by
Garmin and some other devices) and display various graphs and allow reportings
on them.

To run the application, you will need to install Racket (www.racket-lang.org).
You will need versin 6.1.1, the newer versions have some bugs and the
resulting application will not display graphs corectly.

To run the application, open "run.rkt" and run it (Ctrl-R).

To build the application, open "build.rkt", evaluate it (Ctrl-R), than run the
commands:

        (build-app)
        (mkdist)

This will create a stand-alone application in a folder ../ActivityLog2-dist.

Enjoy.
