# ActivityLog2 - analyze data from swim, bike and run activities

Import swim, bike and run and other activities from .FIT files.  Display
plots, scatter plots, histograms, maps and other views for activities.  Show
reports and trends from activity data and track equipment usage.

Data from the application can be exported as CSV, to be further analyzed by
other tools, or, if you know [Racket](http://www.racket-lang.org), you can
easily use various data manipulations from Racket REPL itself.

Visit the project [web site](http://alex-hhh.github.io/ActivityLog2), download
pre-built releases from the
[releases](https://github.com/alex-hhh/ActivityLog2/releases) page, or see
